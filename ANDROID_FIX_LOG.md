# Android Export Fix Log

## Issues Identified
1. **Empty export_presets.cfg** - Required for Android export configuration
2. **Incorrect JAVA_HOME** - Was pointing to JDK 22, but Godot/Gradle needs JDK 17
3. **Missing builds directory** - Export path didn't exist
4. **Gradle build environment** - Not properly configured

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created export_presets.cfg
- Added complete Android export preset configuration
- Set target SDK to 34, min SDK to 24
- Enabled ARM64 architecture (most common for modern devices)
- Configured package name as "com.poreflexgame.app"
- Set export path to "builds/android/PoReflexGame.apk"
- Enabled internet permission for API connectivity

### 2. Fixed Java Environment
- Identified correct Java 17 installation: `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.14.7-hotspot`
- Created `fix_android_env.bat` script to set proper environment variables
- Verified Gradle 8.2 compatibility with Java 17

### 3. Created Build Directory Structure
- Created `builds/` directory
- Created `builds/android/` subdirectory for APK output

## Next Steps

### For Manual Testing:
1. Run `fix_android_env.bat` to set environment variables
2. Open Godot Editor
3. Go to Project → Export
4. Select "Android" preset
5. Click "Export Project" or "Export All"

### If Issues Persist:
1. Check Android SDK installation in Godot Editor:
   - Go to Editor → Editor Settings → Export → Android
   - Verify Android SDK Path
   - Download export templates if missing

2. Ensure debug keystore exists:
   - File already present: `debug.keystore`
   - This is used for debug builds

3. Check gradle.properties:
   - Verify Android settings are compatible

## Environment Requirements Met:
- ✅ Java 17 (compatible with Gradle 8.2)
- ✅ Gradle 8.2 
- ✅ Android SDK Target 34
- ✅ Export presets configured
- ✅ Build output directory created

## Known Working Configuration:
- **Java Version**: OpenJDK 17.0.14
- **Gradle Version**: 8.2
- **Target SDK**: 34
- **Min SDK**: 24
- **Architecture**: ARM64-v8a (primary), ARMv7 (disabled for performance)
